During development, if you want a different base path other than "/", simply execute the "ng serve" command with --base-href option set to your desired base path as shown below.
ng serve -o --base-href /emp/

if you want to deploy your application on a server on sub-folder called "emp", then you will have to remember to update the base href element value in index.html to "/emp/". There are 2 ways we can do this. 
Manually update the index.html file OR
Use the --base-href option along with the ng build command as shown below. This will update the "base href" element value index.html.
ng build --base-href /emp/
